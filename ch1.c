Heterogeneous parallel Computing
    - Combine general purpose x86 CPU(s) with one or more accelerators
    - combined CPU & GPU system
    -  Use different hardware for different types of computation
        - CPU does sequential computing
        - GPU does parallel computing
    - types of accelerators: GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, Intel Xeon Phi




FLOPS
    - Floating Point Operation Per Second
    -MFLOPS: 10^6
    -GFLOPS: 10^9
    -TFLOPS: 10^12


GPU Motivation
    1. Power and Cooling
        - GPU use Parallelism that Saves Power

    2. Compute Capability
        - GPU work extremely fast and efficient at parallel computing

Multicore: describe CPU
Manycore: descirbe GPU with "many cores"


Microprocessor Limit:
    1. Power density
    2. Hidden Parallelism
    3. Chip Yield
    4. Speed of Light




3 ways to accelerate using GPU

    Libraries                   Compiler Directives         Programming Languages
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    "Drop-in" Acceleration      Easily accelerate           Max flexibility
    medium performance          portable                    High performance
